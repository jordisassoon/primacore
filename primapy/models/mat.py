class MAT(KNeighborsRegressor):
    """
    Modern Analogue Technique (MAT) using K-Nearest Neighbors.

    This class inherits from sklearn's KNeighborsRegressor and applies a
    custom distance metric known as the squared chord distance, commonly
    used in ecological and pollen-based reconstructions.

    MAT adds convenience methods for:
      - Batched predictions with progress tracking.
      - Retrieving detailed information about nearest neighbors, including
        metadata from a DataFrame.
      - Exporting KNN parameters for reproducibility or logging.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _fitted_X : np.ndarray
        Training features stored after fitting.
    _fitted_y : np.ndarray
        Training targets stored after fitting.

        n_neighbors : int, default=3
            Number of nearest neighbors to consider in predictions.
        distance_metric : str, default='squared_chord'
            Distance metric to use. Options are 'squared_chord' or 'chord'.

        Compute the squared chord distance between two samples.

        This is the core distance metric used in MAT. It is commonly used
        in ecological studies because it accounts for relative abundances
        rather than absolute differences.

        Formula:
            d(x1, x2) = sum_i (sqrt(x1_i) - sqrt(x2_i))^2

        Parameters
        ----------
        x1, x2 : array-like
            Feature vectors of two samples. Typically representing relative
            abundances or counts (e.g., pollen taxa percentages).
